# Contributor Code of Conduct 📝

## Hey There, Fellow Contributor! 👋

Welcome to our project! We're building **SocialSphere** - a revolutionary platform that empowers communities to create and manage customizable DAOs and human-verified membership and we want to keep it a friendly, inclusive, and collaborative space for everyone. Whether you're fixing a tiny typo or developing a major feature, your contributions matter, and so does the way we treat each other.

## How We Work Together 🤝

- **Be kind and respectful** – We're all here to learn, build, and grow. A little kindness goes a long way!
- **Stay open and inclusive** – We welcome everyone, no matter their background, experience level, or identity.
- **Communicate clearly** – Constructive feedback is great; personal attacks are not. Keep discussions productive and helpful.
- **Help each other out** – If someone’s stuck, lend a hand. If you’re stuck, ask for help. Collaboration makes us stronger!

## What’s Not Cool 🚫

We want this to be a positive space, so here’s what won’t fly:

- Harassment, discrimination, or making anyone feel unwelcome.
- Trolling, personal attacks, or toxic behavior.
- Sharing private info without permission.
- Anything that disrupts a constructive and open environment.

## If Something Goes Wrong 🚨

If you experience or witness behavior that goes against our values, please reach out to the maintainers on **[X](https://x.com/SocialSphereDAO)**. We'll handle it confidentially and fairly.

## What Happens If Someone Crosses the Line? 🚧

Project maintainers can step in to edit or remove harmful contributions, and in serious cases, contributors may be temporarily or permanently banned. Our goal is to keep this space safe and welcoming for all.

## Inspired By 💡

This Code of Conduct is based on the awesome [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

## Let’s Keep It Visible! 📌

This document is linked in our [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) so that everyone knows what we stand for.

Let’s build cool stuff together and make this an open-source project where everyone feels welcome. Happy coding! 🚀
